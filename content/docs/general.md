# General Info

## Project Description

Group project from CS 7643 Deep Learning taught at Georgia Tech (online section).

The goal of the project is to use transformers along with attention mechanisms 
to build a model in Pytorch,
for making bet / fold decisions in No-Limit Texas Hold'em (NLHE)
River situations based on action sequences and card states,
derived from real poker datasets,
as well as computed game-theoretic optimal (GTO) values.
